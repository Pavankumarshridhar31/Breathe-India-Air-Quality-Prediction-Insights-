Key objectives of the project:

Data Exploration & Visualization: Perform extensive analysis to understand the air quality trends, sources of pollution, and geographical variations across India.
Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast air quality indices, enabling future predictions based on a day  data.
Air Quality Insights: Offer insights into pollutant patterns.
Performance Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 23.22
R^2 Score: 0.9975
The model achieved excellent performance, with an R² score of 0.9975, indicating a near-perfect fit to the data. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 23.22 further shows that the model’s predictions are very close to the actual observed values.
